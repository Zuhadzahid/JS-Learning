// Rules for naming variable

// there are two types opf convention. its means its dont a rule but it is a best practices of writing a javscript variable 
// 1 ) camelCase wriitng its mean firstName
// 2 ) snake case writing its mean first_name

// we can use both case for making our variables 

// now what are the rules of variables names declaration 

// first rule 

// we can not start with number 
// for example 

// var 2name = "Hello world";

// this is gives an error intead of this we can use 

var name2 = "Hello World"
console.log(name2);

// second rule 

// we can only use "$" symbol and "_" symbol in first place of the varibale or in between even we can not give a space in the vairables name it give us a error 

// for example 

// var first Name = "Hello World"; 
// var *firstName = "Hello World"; 
// var or (anyother symbol first) then firstName = "Hello World" 

// All of the above example gives an error 

// so instead of this we can only use 

var _first = "Hello World";
console.log(_first);

var $first = "Hello World";
console.log($first);

var first_Name = "Hello World"
console.log(first_Name);

var first$Name = "Hello World"
console.log(first$Name);
